## specula

**Dataset description:** Hijacks Outlook, egress via HTTPS tcp 443
```bash
rita view specula
```

1. One host shows an extremely high connection count (34,873) to an external IP with a rare signature ACMS/1.0. What is the destination IP?

 
2. A High-severity entry shows a very low Beacon Score (0.087) despite a very long total duration (>79,000 seconds). What FQDN was contacted?

 
3. A Medium-severity flow goes to an external IP on a non-standard high port (32526) and is tagged with a mime_type_mismatch. What was the full Port:Proto:Service string for this entry?

 
4. One entry shows Outlook communicating with its cloud infrastructure and includes a rare signature revealing a User-Agent string with an Office/Outlook build. What is the exact rare signature value?

 
5. An entry (Severity: None) shows a Microsoft delivery host (1a.tlu.dl.delivery.mp.microsoft.com) transferring an unusually large volume of bytes (~78 million), flagged with a mime_type_mismatch. What is the exact total megabytes value shown in the dataset?

 
6. One entry (Severity: None) shows communication with an external IP over port 443 but with two different protocols listed (UDP + TCP). What is the destination IP?
