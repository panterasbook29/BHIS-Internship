Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, scalable data store, and vector database built on Apache Lucene. It’s optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. Use Elasticsearch to search, index, store, and analyze data of all shapes and sizes in near real time. Kibana is the graphical user interface for Elasticsearch. It’s a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing your data, and for managing and monitoring the Elastic Stack.

Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack. Combined with Kibana, it powers these Elastic solutions and use cases:
- **Elasticsearch** - Build powerful search and RAG applications using Elasticsearch's vector database, AI toolkit, and advanced retrieval capabilities
- **Observability** - Resolve problems with open, flexible, and unified observability powered by advanced machine learning and analytics
- **Security** - Detect, investigate, and respond to threats with AI-driven security analytics to protect your organization at scale
