Being the first time I have heard of it, I was pretty sure it wasn't the motorcycle, I had to search hayabusa event log to find the repo:
[Hayabusa-Repo](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa)
# What I used to install on a fedora OS:
- $sudo dnf install git rust cargo
- $git clone https://github.com/Yamato-Security/hayabusa.git
- $cd hayabusa
- $cargo build --release
- ### I got an error on the build and had to install PerlCore: $sudo dnf install perl-core + $cargo clean + again $cargo build --release
- $sudo cp target/release/hayabusa /usr/local/bin/  (so I can use it from anywhere)

### FYI 'dnf' is the same as 'apt' and 'cargo' is pretty much 'make' from kali

# Some notes and links
- This tools is basically a cli version of the Windows Event Viewer, much better in my opinion, but it can't work in real time
- Had a hard time finding the new command syntaxes, as they have changed over the years
- I prefer it to the Windows Event Viewer, easier to do bulk searching
- You can't do much without updating the rules
- You still need to know what to look for in the files you export, it doesn't hint you towards anything, just makes you do 80% of your job in 20% of the time
- Took me a good while to find some good .evtx file to play with: [Log File For Lab](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/blob/master/datasets/attack_techniques/T1003.003/atomic_red_team/windows-sysmon.log)
