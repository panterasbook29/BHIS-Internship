# Deception Systems
The goal of deception technology is to draw cybercriminals to a trap or decoy instead of an organization's real assets. In order to fool the criminal into thinking they have infiltrated and obtained access to the company's most valuable assets when they haven't, the decoy imitates authentic servers, apps, and data. The tactic is used to reduce harm and safeguard an organization's real assets.

Organizations rarely use deception technology as their main cybersecurity tactic. Protection against all unauthorized access is the aim of any security posture, and once a suspected breach has occurred, deception technology can be a helpful tactic to have in place. Protecting the company's actual assets may depend on directing the cybercriminal to phony information and login credentials.

Research is another advantage of deceptive technology. IT security analysts can gain a thorough understanding of cybercriminals' behavior by examining how they breach the security perimeter and try to steal what they perceive to be authentic data. In fact, some organizations deploy a centralized deception server that records the movements of malicious actorsâ€”first as they gain unauthorized access and then as they interact with the decoy. The server records and tracks every vector utilized during the attack, giving the IT staff useful information to improve security and stop future occurrences of the same kind of attack.

Cybercriminals have increased the magnitude, scope, and sophistication of their attacks, and a breach could be more severe than the deception server and its related shadow or imitation assets can manage. This is the drawback or danger of deception technology. Furthermore, because the deception server and decoy assets are immediately visible to cybercriminals, they may be able to swiftly ascertain that they are being duped. As a result, they can swiftly stop the offensive and probably come back stronger. 

Deception technology must be invisible to an organization's workers, subcontractors, or clients in order to operate effectively.
