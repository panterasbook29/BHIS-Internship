Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, scalable data store, and vector database built on Apache Lucene. It’s optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. Use Elasticsearch to search, index, store, and analyze data of all shapes and sizes in near real time. Kibana is the graphical user interface for Elasticsearch. It’s a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing your data, and for managing and monitoring the Elastic Stack.

Elasticsearch is the heart of the Elastic Stack. Combined with Kibana, it powers these Elastic solutions and use cases:
- **Elasticsearch** - Build powerful search and RAG applications using Elasticsearch's vector database, AI toolkit, and advanced retrieval capabilities
- **Observability** - Resolve problems with open, flexible, and unified observability powered by advanced machine learning and analytics
- **Security** - Detect, investigate, and respond to threats with AI-driven security analytics to protect your organization at scale

### Let's go through downloading and installing it
1. **Install Java** - $`sudo dnf install java-21-openjdk -y`
2. **Add Elastic GPG Key and Repo**
- $`sudo rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch`
- $<pre>cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/elastic.repo
[elastic-8.x]
name=Elastic repository for 8.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
EOF</pre>
3. **Install Elasticsearch** - $`sudo dnf install elasticsearch -y`
4. **Enable and start elastic** - $`sudo systemctl enable --now elasticsearch`
5. **Install Kibana** - $`sudo dnf install kibana -y`
6. **Enable and start kibana** - $`sudo systemctl enable --now kibana` (Access via browser at: http://localhost:5601)
7. **Install Filebeat (for log forwarding)** - $`sudo dnf install filebeat -y`
8. **Enable and start filebeat** - $`sudo systemctl enable --now filebeat`
<br><br>
9. **Configuring**

Let's disable authentication for this lab
- $`sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` - make sure this line is present and not commented: `xpack.security.enabled: false` and `xpack.security.enrollment.enabled: false`
- $`sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch`
- $`sudo nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml` - make sure this line is present and not commented: `elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]`
- $`sudo systemctl restart kibana` 
- $`sudo nano /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml` - make sure you have these:

<pre>output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
</pre>
<pre>setup.kibana:
  host: "localhost:5601"
</pre>

- $`sudo systemctl restart filebeat`

### If filebeat errors because of system do this, else skip to next step
- $`sudo filebeat modules enable system`
- $`sudo nano /etc/filebeat/modules.d/system.yml` - make sure you have something like this:

<pre>
module: system
  syslog:
    enabled: true
  auth:
    enabled: true</pre>

- $`sudo systemctl restart filebeat` & verify $`sudo systemctl status filebeat`

## Let's finally open Kibana at <pre>http://localhost:5601</pre>

- Let's choose `Explore on my own`, now you oficially have a SIEM system setup on your computer
- As a continuation, take onto the hands-on lab for [Elastic](/courseFiles/Lab_02-toolsAndPlatforms/elasticLab.md)
